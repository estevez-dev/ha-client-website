New, truly native Home Assistant Android client is ready for open alpha testing!
It is fast and comfortable. It is designed to make all Home Assistant users with Android phones happy. Well, that is planned.

Now you will not get widgets, Wear OS support and native Android notifications because it is still alpha version. But youâ€™ll get pretty fast way to see and interact with Home Assistant entities. And be sure that widgets and notifications are coming, because this is a reason why you see this app and help us to test and improve it.

The main idea is:

- To build an app that will present all the functionality of Home Assistant web-based UI in a native Android way with fast navigation and interaction
- To add custom functionality like location tracking, native notifications, widget and so on
